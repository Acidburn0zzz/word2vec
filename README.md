word2vec in go lang

Thanks to these guys - https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/

Main motivations are that I used gensim with the freebase vectors skipgram file and it ended up using 27Gb of ram.
I'm not particularly intestested in writting c++ so to golang. Right now the distance part uses ~11Gb of memory for the same file.
